## Prediction Using Decision Tree Algorithm

The decision tree Algorithm is a member of the supervised machine learning algorithm family. It can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.

In this project, I created the Decision Tree Classifier and visualized it graphically among different givern features.

The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
