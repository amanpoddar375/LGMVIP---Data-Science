## Stock Market Prediction Using Stacked LSTM

Machine learning has significant applications in the stock price prediction. In this machine learning project, we will be talking about predicting the returns on stocks using LSTM. This is a very complex task and has uncertainties

LSTMs are widely used for sequence prediction problems and have proven to be extremely effective. The reason they work so well is that LSTM can store past important information and forget the information that is not.
