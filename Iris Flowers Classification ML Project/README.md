## Iris Flowers Classification ML Project

The classification of iris flowers is a popular machine learning project. This particular ML project is known as the "Hello World" of Machine Learning. The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers: Versicolor, Setosa, and Virginica, and each class has four features: 'Sepal length,' 'Sepal width,' 'Petal length,' and 'Petal width,' and it is ideal for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, specifically how to load and handle data. Furthermore, because this is a small dataset, it can be easily fit in memory without the need for special transformations or scaling capabilities.

The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features.
